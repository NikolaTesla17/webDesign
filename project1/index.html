        <p>While the Roman Emperor Nero may have had a few shortcomings he certainly knew how to 
        do excessively lavish opulence right. One of his more interesting displays of  extravenece
         was a banqueting room that would rain flower petals and perfume from its ceiling. Although 
         this room may cause some issues with both allergies and perfume falling into your goblet, 
         it certainly does make an impression. Upon hearing that we, the nieces and nephews were 
         tasked with creating a flower dispersal method for the wedding, I of course petitioned hard 
         for the Nero solution to flower dispersal. However, it turned out that the wedding was 
         outside, and all the turnkey solutions for megalomaniacal flower dispersal were either 
         ceiling based, prohibitively expensive, or painted with particularly garish colors. So we 
         settled on building an RC car that could be controlled through a website. The car would need
          vision capabilities so that anyone could drive the car from their phone without having to 
          be near it and it would have to be relatively inexpensive and easy to make, we only had all
           summer after all.
