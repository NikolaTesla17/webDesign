        <p>We eventually settled upon making a donkeyCar. To put it simply, a donkeyCar is a 
          normal RC car with the original brain ripped out and another, smarter brain 
          frankensteined in.  The base of the donkeyCar is a standard RC car and a RaspberryPi.
           After some light disassembly, an extra servo shield and a handful of voided warranties
            the RaspberryPi can be easily connected to the car. Now we get to the fun part, the 
            software. As all of you who have used a raspberryPi, or really any linux based computer 
            would know, ARRGGGGHHHHHHHHHH. Well, it's not that bad. All you need to do is a headless 
            setup of the pi, SSH into it, Install some dependencies, undervolt the CPU, setup a virtual
             environment, clone a GitHub repo, ignore some warnings, set up some domain forwarding, 
             and finally make sure it all works. However, once you’ve done all that you have the 
             world's coolest Minecraft Box/Emulator. In order to see how it disperses flowers, I don’t 
             know, look at the wedding or something. We can’t do everything ourselves.
